# Prog1-HW4

Write a program to tackle the following problem. All programming should use good function and variable names and sufficient comments for improved readability.

We want to expand upon the count function we developed in class. The user will input a string and a list of characters (also input as a string, without spaces). Then your program will count the number of times *any* character in the list appears in the string. Your program should have at least one function defined, as specified below.

Required functions:
- A function taking 2 parameters string and chars; string is the string we wish to count within, and chars is the list of characters (a string containing each character to be counted). The function returns the number of times any character in chars appears in the string.

*Hint: there are at least two good ways to tackle this problem. You might find yourself using a for loop inside a for loop, or using a conditional with the "in" keyword inside a for loop. Feel free to use either of these methods, or any other method you come up with.*


***Bonus***

Write a second function which solves the same problem using a fundamentally different approach (you may choose to implement both of my suggested routes, or come up with some other method that is distinct from these). Feel free to reach out if you are unsure if your different approaches are different enough for the bonus.
